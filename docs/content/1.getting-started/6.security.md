## Security Overview

The Bugzilla MCP Server requires Bugzilla API access to function. Following security best practices is essential to protect your Bugzilla instance and data.

## API Key Security

### Create Dedicated API Keys

:::prose-warning
Never use administrative accounts or full-access API keys with the MCP server.
:::

1. **Create a dedicated Bugzilla user account** for MCP access
2. **Generate a dedicated API key** with minimal required permissions
3. **Use separate API keys** for different environments (development, production)

### API Key Permissions

Restrict API key permissions to only necessary operations:

- **Read-only operations**: If you only need to query bugs, use read-only permissions
- **Comment permissions**: Only enable comment permissions if you need to add comments
- **Avoid administrative permissions**: Never grant administrative or full-access permissions

### API Key Storage

:::prose-warning
Never commit API keys or credentials to version control.
:::

**Best Practices:**
- Store API keys in secure configuration files (not in code)
- Use environment variables when possible
- Never share API keys in public repositories
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

## Configuration Security

### Secure Configuration Files

**Claude Desktop:**
- File location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
- Ensure proper file permissions (readable only by your user)

**Cursor IDE:**
- File location: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Add to `.gitignore` if in a repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive values when possible

**Visual Studio Code:**
- Store `mcp.json` securely
- Don't commit to version control

### Environment Variables

For local development, consider using environment variables:

```bash
export BUGZILLA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export BUGZILLA_URL="https://bugzilla.example.com"
```

## Network Security

### Use HTTPS

:::prose-warning
Always use HTTPS for Bugzilla URLs in production environments.
:::

- **Production**: Always use `https://` URLs
- **Development**: Use `https://` when possible, even for local instances
- **Never use HTTP** for production Bugzilla instances

### Hosted Server

The hosted production server at `https://bugzilla.fastmcp.app/mcp`:
- Uses HTTPS for secure connections
- Does not store or log your API keys
- Transmits credentials only in HTTP headers (not in URLs)

## Security Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Created a dedicated Bugzilla user account for MCP access
- [ ] Generated API key with minimal required permissions
- [ ] Using HTTPS for Bugzilla URL
- [ ] API key stored securely (not in code or version control)
- [ ] Configuration files have proper permissions
- [ ] Regular security reviews of API key usage
- [ ] API keys rotated periodically
- [ ] Monitoring for unauthorized access
- [ ] Using read-only permissions when possible
- [ ] Separate API keys for different environments

## Principle of Least Privilege

:::prose-warning
Always follow the principle of least privilege when configuring API access.
:::

**What this means:**
- Grant only the minimum permissions necessary
- Use read-only access when write access isn't needed
- Separate accounts for different use cases
- Regular review of permissions

## Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting

Consider implementing rate limiting for production use:
- Prevents abuse of the Bugzilla API
- Protects your Bugzilla instance from overload
- May be handled by your Bugzilla instance configuration

### Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling:
- Doesn't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Provides clear error messages without revealing internals
- Handles authentication failures gracefully

### Audit Logging

Monitor API key usage:
- Review Bugzilla access logs regularly
- Check for unusual activity
- Revoke unused or suspicious API keys

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security issue:

1. **Immediately revoke** the compromised API key
2. **Generate a new API key** with appropriate permissions
3. **Update your configuration** with the new key
4. **Review access logs** for unauthorized activity
5. **Report security issues** to your Bugzilla administrator
