## Quick Start (Hosted Server)

The easiest way to get started is to use the hosted production server. No installation or local setup required!

1. **Get your Bugzilla API key** from your Bugzilla instance:
   - Navigate to: `https://your-bugzilla-instance.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey`
   - Generate a new API key if you don't have one

2. **Configure your MCP client** (see [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration) for details):
   - Add the server URL: `https://bugzilla.fastmcp.app/mcp`
   - Add your API key and Bugzilla URL as headers

That's it! You're ready to use the Bugzilla MCP Server.

## Local Development

If you want to run the server locally for development or testing:

::steps
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`

### Install dependencies

Using `uv` (recommended):

```bash [Terminal]
uv sync
```

Or with standard Python:

```bash [Terminal]
pip install fastmcp httpx python-dotenv
```

### Run the server

Using `uv`:

```bash [Terminal]
uv run python server.py
```

Or with standard Python:

```bash [Terminal]
python server.py
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/`

### Configure your MCP client

For local development, use `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` as the server URL in your MCP client configuration.

## Development Setup

For contributing to the project:

::prose-steps
### Clone the repository

```bash [Terminal]
git clone <repository-url>
cd bugzilla-mcp
```

### Create virtual environment

```bash [Terminal]
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

### Install dependencies

```bash [Terminal]
uv sync
```

### Inspect the server

You can inspect the MCP server to see available tools:

```bash [Terminal]
fastmcp inspect server.py:mcp
```

This will show you all available tools, their parameters, and descriptions.
